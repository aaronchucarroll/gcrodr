# GCRO DR - GCRO with Defalted Restarting
# X = GCRODR(A, B, M, K) attempts to solve the system of linear equations A*X = B for X
# A must be an n x n coefficient matrix
# B must be a column vector of length n
# M is the maximum subspace dimension used by GCRODR
# K is the number of approximate eigenvectors kept from one cycle to the next
# OPTIONAL PARAMS:
# x0 specifies an initial guess. The default is an all zero vector
